# Head-Pose-Estimation-ML1_Project
The "Head Pose Estimation" project focuses on developing a system that can accurately estimate the pose (orientation) of a person's head in images or video frames.
The project aims to utilize computer vision techniques to determine the rotation and translation of the head relative to the camera.
